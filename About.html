    <h1>About us</h1>

    <p>At Almanac Construction, we produce a revolutionary new type of building block that reduces the cost of construction by up to 70% in most cases, by eliminating the need for mortar or any plaster works, by reducing the number of skilled workers needed for any project, and by drastically increasing the speed of construction, without compromise to neither aesthetics nor durability. Though interlocking soil stabilized blocks have been in existence for a very long time, it is only relatively recently that the technology and machinery used to produce these blocks in large quantities became viable. Interlocking Blocks are physically superior to the bricks and blocks we commonly use today in every metric ranging from being bulletproof and fireproof to providing a noticeably cooler interior</p>
